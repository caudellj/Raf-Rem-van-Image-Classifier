# Raf-Rem-van-Image-Classifier
A computer vision model trained to identify Rafael, Rembrandt, and van Gogh paintings

The Jupyter notebook `Raf-Rem-van Image Classifier.ipynb` contains a demo, with documentation and exposition,
of a CNN I trained to classify a painting as either a Rafael, a Rembrandt, or a van Gogh. The file `catalog.xlsx` 
is a database of paintings hosted on the Web Gallery of Art `www.wga.hu`.
